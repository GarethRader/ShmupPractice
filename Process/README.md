#Process


09.26.20 - Initial movement and firing mechanics have been made

    NEXT: dashing, dodging, and other movement mechanics and fine tuning. Firing/combat mechanics will be developed at a later time.



Long term plans (not finalized and subject to change):

    - Tech Tree system for player (class system)
        - involves evolution tracks to evolve as a bacteria
        - researched in a lab of white blood cells? (similar to npcs in Enter the Gungeon?)
        - potentially different types of player-controlled bacteria

    - Combat system:
        - might be a form of complicated rock-paper-scissors 
        - certain strands of bacteria may be better than others at fighting specific enemies
        - grow as you survive longer and kill more enemies
            - sacrifice small parts of player character to use powerful abilities?

    - Simple Physics system:
        - collision detection

    - Different enemy types:
        - three main types:
            - Parasites
            - viruses
            - bacteria
        enemy list consisting of but not limited to: E. coli (and different strands), listeria, salmonella, camplyobactor, shigella, rotavirus, giardia, cryptosporidium, staphylococcus
            - pathing and targetting for enemies?
            - PLAN: heuristic behaviors for certain enemies?

    - Randomly generated enemies
        - size depends on health, which varies per enemy
        - same with damage
        - slower if bigger
        AMBITIOUS goals: 
            - nemesis system or some form of it
            - Randomly generated environments/maps?
            - enemies will evolve too!?!?!
